Time Complexity - It is used to measure the algorithm running time as the input grows

1. Time Complexity !== Time taken
2. To represent time complexity we use Big O notation
3. Big O natation give the worst case, because comparing worse case give the efficient algorithm.
4. Common Time Complexity
    1. O(n)
    2. O(log n)
    3. O(n log n)
    4. O(n square)
    5. 0(2 raised to n)
    6. O(1) - Constaint Time COmplexity - Best
    7. O(n!)
5. Efficiency
    O(1) > O(log n) > O(n) > O(n log n) > O(n sqaure) > O(2 raised to n) > O(n!)
