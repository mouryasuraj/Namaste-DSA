1. First of all, DSA is language-agnostic
2. We will going to use Javascript Programming Language to solve DSA questions
3. Steps to solve DSA:
    --> Read the question carefully (read again if you don't understand)
    --> Think about the approach to solve the question and write it down on paper.
    --> After getting the idea, write the code and run it.
    --> Then try to optimize the solution if possible.
    --> Finally, check the Time and Space complexity of the code.
